      <p>Furever Friends is an adoption centre based just outside Belfast. We first opened our doors
      in 2012 in a bid to rescue and rehome as many lost/abandon animals across Belfast and Northern
    Ireland as possible. Since then we have had the privilege of rehoming over 4000 pets! But, there
  are still so many animals that need a loving home. Could you be the one to provide that for them? </p>

  <p>Here at Furever Friends we want to make it as easy as possible for you to meet your new best Friend
  so we've created this site to enable you to view all our current residents that are up for adoption, hear
stories from past rehomed pets, and keep up to date with local adoption events! </p>
  <p>To start your journey head over to our navigation bar, select from the drop down menu the kind of animal your
  looking for, then select one of the available pets to find out a little bit more about them! Once youve found the pet your
looking for click the 'select pet' button and you'll be directed to our contact page where you can fill in your details
and we'll be in touch with more information as soon as possible.</p>
